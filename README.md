# Predicting-Heart-Disease-using-ML-Algorithms
This notebook looks into using various Python machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes

we are going to take the following approach:

Problem definition
Data
Evaluation
Features
Modelling
Experimentation
